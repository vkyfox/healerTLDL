![Kerachole](./kerachole.png "Kerachole_icon") ![Kerachole_buffs](./kerachole_buffs.png "Kerachole_buffs") [30s CD] **Kerachole** : 10% mitigation + low regen for 15s.

This is the staple for all raid damages, due to its double part regen, keep an eye out for it being used early before raid damage, as it can save you topping the group yourself.



![Physis II](./physis_II.png "Physis II icon") ![Physis II buffs](./physis_II_buffs.png "Physis II icon") [60s CD] **Physis II** : Medium regen for 15s + 10% *action* healing buff for 10s.

Note the healing buff icon on the left, and the regen on the right. It being healing *action* potency buff, it will only affect GCD healing. Meaning, most of the time you can forget this part. The regen is definitely potent though, so keep an eye out for it as it will have around 25% uptime.



![Holos](./holos.png "Holos icon") ![Holos buff](./holos_buff.png "Holos buff") [120s CD] **Holos** : 10% mitigation for 20s + medium heal.

The 20s duration is the very unusual part about this skill. Very efficient on long mechanics with lots of repeat damage. The healing part means you don't have to top if you know your sage is gonna use it.


![Panhaima](./panhaima.png "HolosPanhaima icon") ![Panhaima buffs](./panhaima_buffs.png "Panaima buffs")  [120s CD] **Panhaima** : 5 times self-reapplying low shield for 15s. Leftover shields heal based on stacks left.

Very useful for repeat mechanics, as above. Do not forget the healing part, as it will rarely ever use its five stacks in 15s.


![Pneuma](./pneuma.png "Pneuma icon") [120s CD] **Pneuma** : High to Very High burst healing.

Much harder for you to keep track of, however you should keep it in in mind as it comes to no DPS loss for the Sage and is *extremely* potent.
